    "# Object Oriented Programming in Python\n",
    "To the research engineer, a language like Python has a lot of upside; readability, flexibility, and is arguably the quickest to get up-and-running. Ironically, this can also be a \"con\" of the language. Its ease of use can have you building scripts so quickly that users can miss the features that makes Python powerful. Among these features stands the object oriented paradigm."

Below would be an example of procedural programming. \n",

This method took these arguments, and stored them in the attributes `name`, `price`, and `aisle`, as defined by the function. And when we created this `coffee` variable, this became an **instance** of the class, thus, this process is called **instantiation**. In this context, the terms **instance** and **object** can be used interchangably. \n",
